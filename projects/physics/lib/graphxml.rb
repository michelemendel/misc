# graphxml.rb
#
# This file contains minimal support for creating RGL graphs from the GraphML
# format (see http://www.graphdrawing.org/graphml).  The main purpose is to
# have a rich set of example graphs to have some more tests.
#
# See the examples directory, which contains a subdirectory _north_ with the
# Graph catalog GraphViz (see
# http://www.research.att.com/sw/tools/graphviz/refs.html).
#
# We use REXML::StreamListener from the REXML library
# (http://www.germane-software.com/software/rexml) to parse the grapml files.

  # is loaded.
